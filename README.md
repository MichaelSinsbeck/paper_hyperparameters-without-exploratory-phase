Research code for the paper "Exploratory-phase-free estimation of GP hyperparameters in sequential design methods - at the example of Bayesian inverse problems"

This code reproduces all of the results in the article.

The core functionality is contained in the package "bbi", which stands for "Bayesian Bayesian Inversion". Later, this package was refactored and named "bali" for "Bayesian Likelihood Estimation".

I created the individual experiments with more than a year of time in between. Therefore, the some experiments use bbi and some use bali.

Experiments are:

1. Source Identification
2. Sorption
3. Curve fitting
4. CO2 Benchmark problem
5. Source Identification (Bi-Modal Variant)
